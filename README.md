## 🔧 Usage

- **Theme Toggle**: Click the moon/sun icon to switch between light / dark modes.

- **ScrollSpy**: Navbar highlights current section while scrolling.

- **Experience Filter**: Use the dropdown to filter experience cards by company.

- **Project Filters**:

    - Tech & Year dropdowns populate dynamically based on project data.

    - Click on a project image to toggle its description.

## 📚 How It Works

- **Experience & Project Sections** are fully generated from JavaScript using JSON arrays.

- Filters `(<select>)` populate dynamically from data during initialization.

- **Bootstrap 5 ScrollSpy** is enabled via data-bs-spy="scroll" and JS init.

- **AOS** is initialized and refreshed after dynamic rendering for proper on-scroll animations.

- All interactive elements are implemented with vanilla JS for performance and simplicity.

## 📌 To Customize

- Update `experienceData.js` and `projects.js` to add/remove items.

- Adjust filters and render logic if adding new attributes (e.g., tags, difficulty).

- Modify `style.css` or override Bootstrap variables for custom visuals.
