## üìö How It Works

- **Experience & Project Sections** are fully generated from JavaScript using JSON arrays.

- Filters `(<select>)` populate dynamically from data during initialization.

- **Bootstrap 5 ScrollSpy** is enabled via `data-bs-spy="scroll"` and JS init.

- **AOS** is initialized and refreshed after dynamic rendering for proper on-scroll animations.

- All interactive elements are implemented with **vanilla JS** for performance and simplicity.

## üìå To Customize

- Update `experienceData.js` and `projects.js` to add/remove items.

- Adjust filters and render logic if adding new attributes (e.g., tags, difficulty).

- Modify `style.css` or override Bootstrap variables for custom visuals.
